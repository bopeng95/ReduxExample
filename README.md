# ReduxExample
Implemented redux with react app based off of [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/)

## How to start
- This application is built from create-react-app
- In `client` folder, `npm install` the react dependencies, then `yarn start` to run React App
	> The react dependencies may have a few vulnerabilities, but the terminal will tell you to fix it by `npm audit fix`
- **console** has redux logger
